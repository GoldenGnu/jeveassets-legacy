#summary Building jEveAssets source

= General Coding Guidelines =

  * We use tab and not space. Be sure to disable "expand tabs to space" in your IDE.
  * Swing JComponent variable names should have leading "j". Ex.: jMyTable
  * No other variable names should use Systems Hungarian
= SVN =

Checkout:
https://jeveassets.googlecode.com/svn/jeveassets/trunk/

We usually work in two branches. If the latest version is 1.0.0 they would be named as follow:
  * New Features: jeveassets-1.1.0
  * Bug Fixes: jeveassets-1.0.X

Bug fixes are committed to both branches.
Experimental features get their own branch.
